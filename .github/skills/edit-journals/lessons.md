# Edit Journals — Lessons & Continuous Improvement

Keep this file short. Append dated one-line notes for rationale when adding examples or clarifications. If this file exceeds **8 dated entries** or becomes longer than a single screen, follow the integration-first consolidation steps below.

## Consolidation policy

- For each older or undated entry:
  1. Pick the best target file in this skill folder for the lesson (e.g., `SKILL.md` procedures, `examples.md`).
  2. Integrate the lesson as a concise clarification or example in that file.
  3. Replace the lesson entry in `lessons.md` with a one-line pointer or delete it after integration.
- Keep `lessons.md` focused on recent actionable items and run `pnpm run format` and `pnpm run test` after edits.

## 2026-02-08

- Prefer `pnpm run format` and `pnpm run check` for validation after edits.
