# Validate Journals — Lessons & Continuous Improvement

Keep this file short. Append dated one-line notes for any recurring validation issues. If this file exceeds **8 dated entries** or becomes longer than a single screen, follow the integration-first consolidation steps below.

## Consolidation policy

- For each older or undated entry:
  1. Determine the best target (e.g., `SKILL.md` guidance or `examples.md` quick fix) and add a concise improvement there.
  2. Replace or remove the lesson entry here with a one-line pointer after integration.
- Keep `lessons.md` focused and recent; run `pnpm run format` and `pnpm run test` after edits.

## 2026-02-08

- Format (`pnpm run format`) before running `pnpm run check` to reduce noise.
