# Match Octopus Statement Transactions — Lessons & Continuous Improvement

Keep this file concise. Append dated one-line notes when adding examples or rule clarifications. If this file exceeds **8 dated entries** or becomes longer than a single screen, follow the integration-first consolidation steps below.

## Consolidation policy

- For each older or undated entry:
  1. Determine whether the lesson should be integrated into `SKILL.md` (behavior/guidelines) or `examples.md` (worked examples).
  2. Add a short update to that file and replace the lesson entry here with a one-line pointer or delete it after integration.
- Keep `lessons.md` recent and actionable; run `pnpm run format` and `pnpm run test` after updates.

## 2026-02-08

- Integrated → `SKILL.md` Behavior: When a non-typical update occurs (minute/hour/date change), the skill must include original and updated datetimes in the summary for human review. See `SKILL.md` summary rules for output format.
