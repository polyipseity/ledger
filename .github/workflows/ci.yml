# CI: Build & Test
#
# Purpose:
#   - Run repository checks: setup pnpm, install dependencies, install hledger, and run `pnpm run check`.
#   - Ensure a minimal, reproducible environment for quick CI feedback.
#
# Triggers:
#   - push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch
#
# Runner selection rationale (why `ubuntu-slim`):
#   - Lightweight: smaller VM image → faster startup and less disk usage.
#   - Reduced attack surface: fewer preinstalled packages lowers risk from CVEs.
#   - Predictable environment: shares core Ubuntu userspace with `ubuntu-latest` while minimizing extras.
#   - Caveats: some system packages may be missing; add `apt-get install` steps when needed, or switch to `ubuntu-latest` for debugging.
#
# Security & reproducibility notes:
#   - Use least-privilege permissions (contents: read) and pin action versions where appropriate.
#   - Use local caches for pnpm/uv to speed builds and reduce external load.

  workflow_dispatch:

# Use concurrency to deduplicate runs.
# - For pull requests: group by `pr-<number>` so multiple commits to the same PR
#   cancel previous runs and only the latest is kept.
# - For direct pushes: fall back to deduplicating by commit SHA so identical
#   commits don't trigger multiple concurrent workflows.
# - Include the `github.workflow` name in the group to avoid cross-workflow collisions.
